- 👋 Hi, I’m @403Chris
- 👀 I’m interested in acquiring more knowledge to further enhance my capabilities in the field of programming, I would certainly appreciate it if I am given some tips and advice on how to approach certain topics. I also like to read novels as a way to reduce stress.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Git and other various Languages and Softwares so that I can officially start my path to programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basic programs for now, but hopefully I would also like to collaborate on stuffs that feature Game Developing.
